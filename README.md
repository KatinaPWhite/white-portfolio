# About Me
Hi there! My name is Katina White. My hobbies include reading YA novels, jamming along to pop-punk bands of the early 2000s, watching YouTube Let's Plays, eating Texas Bar-B-Que, and going to the movies. I also enjoy spending time at home with my boyfriend of almost 8 years, David, and our fur-son Roundtable the cat. I also enjoy travleing with my family, having been to 41 of the 50 U.S. states. One of the most memorable trips was the 8 weeks we spent in an RV traveling the 13,000 miles round-trip from our home in Southwest Florida to Alaska.

As the daughter of a science teacher, I've always been nerdy, enjoying the intersection of arts and science. I also knew that I wanted to do something I loved when I "grew up", so I got my Bachelor's in Theatre from the University of Florida (3rd generation to attend, Go Gators!). After working for a few years I decided I wanted to get my master's in Arts Administration. Currently, I am a Master of Arts Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. I have come to love marketing, as it allows me to be creative, but also support creative decisions in data.

# What I Hope to Learn
What I love about the MAM program is that I have learned so much about the value of data. Specifically, I've learned the importance of data to create better customer experiences and more effectively market to them. I am excited to learn how to better visualize data so that I can better understand what the data is trying to tell me. I am also interested in learning how to better visualize data in order to understand how to create a better user experience for arts organizations. Finally, I am looking forward to being able to communicate data differently, especially to people who are more artistic.
