# Final Project
## Part I
### Outline
For this project, I want to communicate the importance of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for Type 1 Diabetics. I want to show how CGMs provide singificantly more data than Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring which in turn provides better daily care for Type 1 Diabetics and better information for Doctors. Additionally, I want to advocate for insurance reform, to enable Type 1 Diabetics easier access to this technology.

### Data
I plan on utilizing personal CGM Data that I've collected to demonstrate how it functions and why it's better than the Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring Data I have. 
Additionally, more information about CGMs and how much data they collect can be found here:

### Storytelling
I will be using Shorthand to build an tell my story. I will also be using Tableau and Infogram to build the visualizations and infographics

## Part II
### Data Visulaization Tests
I used Infogram to create these initial visuzalizations. These initial wireframes helped me communicate the main thesis of my presentaiton, which is that CGMs provide a significant amount of data, which leads to better health care management as compared to Finger Stick testing. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="53c66b56-7dbd-4849-ae0f-3e2bea39ca3a" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/53c66b56-7dbd-4849-ae0f-3e2bea39ca3a" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

From this first infographic I receieved feedback from some non-diabetic audiences that the red circles weren't intuitive. Clearly they matched the data listed, but why were they red and circles? From this feedback I modified the iconography to the following:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="44592eba-1fc5-4395-9d5c-b898564b117d" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/44592eba-1fc5-4395-9d5c-b898564b117d" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

Again showing this infographic to a non-diabetic, they better understood that it was visualizing blood tests. However, without context, this person thought that CGMs are a bad, as there were more red blood drops than the earlier data. They also questioned why I included perscribed versus used tests. I thought this information was useful in telling the story, as often people use more finger-stick tests than perscribed. I will need to be clear why the distinction in made in the narrative of my story. 

From this feedback I will continue to use Infogram to change the visualization again. I need to keep thinking about how to demonstrate that CGMs collect more data without using blood. I might use an image of a glucose test strip instead, however, those are only used for Finger-Stick testing and I think finger-stick testing is best visualized with blood drops, as those are required for each test. 

### Personal Glucose Data Visulaizations

Here is the link to my public [Tableau 1](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVisualizationFinalPersonalNumbers/Sheet1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes), [Tableau 2](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVisualizationFinalPersonalNumbersSheet2/Sheet2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes), and [Tableau 3](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVisualizationFinalPersonalNumbersSheet3/Sheet3?:embed=y&:display_count=yes) visulationzations.
This is personal CGM data that I was playing with. I am still manipulating it, but plan on incorporating it into my final project. 

Here is the storyboard for my final project using [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/kpwhiteCGMdata/index.html)
The basic outline of the story is there, as well as some attempts to include personal artifacts, specifically my handwritten Glucose Logs after my initial diagnosis.

### Audience
When I first began this assignment I wanted my audience to be the policy students in the room to influence them to advocate for access to continuous glucose technology when they're in policy-making positions. However, as I continued to work and reseach I had trouble finding data on the number of CGM users and how easy or difficult it was for them to get access to this technology. I realized that the "hot button" issue currently is with insulin price increases, which luckliy I haven't experienced. Finally, I had all of this personal data and decided I wanted to tell a more intimate story. So, as I was working on this project I decided I wanted to tell my story. I decided to keep the same general thesis, that CGMs provide more data than finger-stick testing, but I wanted to spin it to show my persopective. 

That being said, the revised audience for this story are the people who know me but don't know all of the details of my diagnosis and disease. The distinction lies in how well I know the person, as my family and boyfriend have intimate knowledge of my diagnosis, diabetes, and CGM technology. Some of my friends also understand some of the elements of my day-to-day healthcare management, but might not understand the nuance of finger-stick versus CGM. The most challenging thing about my intended audience is that we are friends and colleges, but they may lack an understanding of some of the very basic elements diabetes and it's management, which I know very well. Additionally, since my boyfriend and family are also well-versed in "diabetes talk", it's hard to break out of the jargon. 

To help make this project work better for my intended audience, I worked on visual storytelling, including personal artifacts from my experiences. I also made sure to tell my story between the technical writing to keep them engaged and connected. I also worked hard to remove the jargon. I found that using definitions that were designed for the newly diagonsed was helpful, as it assumes the reader is very unfamiliar with the subject. Finally, I realised that I needed to define what a Continuous Glucose Monitor was early in the process to ensure I didn't bury my thesis. This was a challenge because I had to assume the reader didn't know the "traditional" method of glucose testing and then move into what a CGM is then why it's awesome. I didn't utilize a persona because my intended audience is my friends, so I jut made sure to use them instead for feedback. 

### Summary of Work 
The biggest challenge has been figuring out how to communicate the number of tests a CGM does daily compared to finger stick testing. I used Infogram for this visualization, which has it's own learning curve. I was also struggling with how to visualize that the CGM gives glucose readings like the finger stick testing does, but it does it in a different way. I started with red dots, which made no sense. It provided the visual I was looking for - the overwhelming number of tests compared to 3 - but made the information confusing. I then tried blood drops, as I wanted to show that finger-stick testing hurts and requires you to bleed, but this worked in the opposite, as it made CGMs look painful as there were more blood drops. For my final visualization I landed on showing the test strips. I was worried that using the test strips would be confusing, but the wording "Equivalent Number of Tests" clarified that CGMs don't use that many test strips but rather provide that many tests comparitively. I also originally visualized 3, 5, and 288 tests, as I uses more than my 3 perscribed tests and end up paying out-of-pocket when I need more strips. However, this cluttered the visualization and was trying to tell too much. I was trying to lump in the cost associated with test strips on top of advocating for CGMs. It made things too complicated so for my final visual I cut it out. Finally, I struggled getting a clear photo of my test strips to use for the project, especially after looking for stock photos was a nightmare. However, I eventually got what I needed.

I think the biggest lesson I've learned through this process is how much time everything takes. I underestimated how much time it takes to translate the ideas in your head onto the page. I have a greater appreciation for designers and the work they do.
