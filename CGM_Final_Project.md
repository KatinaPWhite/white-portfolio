# Final Project
## Part I
### Outline
For this project, I want to communicate the importance of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for Type 1 Diabetics. I want to show how CGMs provide singificantly more data than Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring which in turn provides better daily care for Type 1 Diabetics and better information for Doctors. Additionally, I want to advocate for insurance reform, to enable Type 1 Diabetics easier access to this technology.

  Glucose Monitoring Data
Why are CGMs are the better option?
  288 tests, including evenings, compared to the perscribed 3 finger sticks

       Test Strip Visualization
       Handwritten Data Diaries
          Way to revisualize that in a "Dear Data" way
  The Implications of this data
      Better Daily Management
          Hypo and Hyper Alerts

   The requirements 
   The cost
Need for Change

### Data
I plan on utilizing personal CGM Data that I've collected to demonstrate how it functions and why it's better than the Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring Data I have. 
Additionally, more information about CGMs and how much data they collect can be found here:

### Storytelling
I will be using Shorthand to build an tell my story. I will also be using RAW and Infogram to build the visualizations and infographics
