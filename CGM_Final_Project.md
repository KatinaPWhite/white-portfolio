# Final Project
## Part I
### Outline
For this project, I want to communicate the importance of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for Type 1 Diabetics. I want to show how CGMs provide singificantly more data than Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring which in turn provides better daily care for Type 1 Diabetics and better information for Doctors. Additionally, I want to advocate for insurance reform, to enable Type 1 Diabetics easier access to this technology.

### Data
I plan on utilizing personal CGM Data that I've collected to demonstrate how it functions and why it's better than the Finger-Stick Glucose Monitoring Data I have. 
Additionally, more information about CGMs and how much data they collect can be found here:

### Storytelling
I will be using Shorthand to build an tell my story. I will also be using RAW and Infogram to build the visualizations and infographics


## Part II
## Data Visulaization Tests
I used Infogram to create these initial visuzalizations. These initial wireframes helped me communicate the main thesis of my presentaiton, which is that CGMs provide a significant amount of data, which leads to better health care management as compared to Finger Stick testing. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="53c66b56-7dbd-4849-ae0f-3e2bea39ca3a" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/53c66b56-7dbd-4849-ae0f-3e2bea39ca3a" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

From this first infographic I recieved feedback from some non-diabetic audiences that the red circles weren't intuitive. Clearly they matched the data listed, but why were they red and circles. From this feedback I modified the iconography to the following:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="44592eba-1fc5-4395-9d5c-b898564b117d" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/44592eba-1fc5-4395-9d5c-b898564b117d" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

Again showing this inforgraphic to some audience members, they better understood that it was visualizing blood tests. However, without context, this non-diabetic audience member thought that CGMs are a bad, as there were more red blood drops than the earlier data. They also questioned why I included perscribed versus used tests. I thought this information was useful in telling the story, as often people use more finger-stick tests than perscribed. I will need to be clear why the distinction in made in the narrative of my story. 

From this feedback I will continue to use Infogram to change the visualization again. I need to keep thuinking about how to demonstrate that CGMs collect mroe data without using blood. I might use an image of a glucose test strip instead, however, those are only used for Finger-Stick testing and I think finger-stick testing is best visualized with blood drops, as those are required for each test. 

Here is the storyboard for my final project using [Shorthand}(https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/kpwhiteCGMdata/index.html)
